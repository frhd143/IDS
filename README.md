# IDS - File Integrity Checker


## Overview
This Python script is designed to check the integrity of files within a directory and its subdirectories. It accomplishes this by generating a hash value for each file and storing the hash value in a log file. By comparing the hash values of the current set of files with the hash values stored in the previous log file, the script can detect if any files have been modified, added, or removed.
